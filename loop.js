// Create a variable that is equal to an empty array and push the values 1-10 into the array using a For Loop

var  myArray  = [];
 for  (var i= 1; i < 11; i++){
myArray.push (i);
}  console.log(myArray);




// Repeat the same steps as above, but you're going to use a While Loop instead, push the values 1-10(inclusive) in descending order.

var myArray = [];
while (var i = 10; i > 0 ;  i -= 1) {
myArray.push (i);
} console.log(myArray);



//Again set a Variable to an empty array but this time push a set of odd numbers 11-21 into the array using a For Loop.

var myArray = [];
For (var i = 21; i <12;  i -= 2 ) {
myArray.push(i);
} console.log(myArray);





//This time around you'll be pushing values onto an array but you will be counting backwards instead! Same set up as the other three questions, but use the numbers 15-1 and count backwards by 2.


var myArray = [];
for (var i = 1;  i < 16;  i -= 2) {
myArray.push (i);
}
